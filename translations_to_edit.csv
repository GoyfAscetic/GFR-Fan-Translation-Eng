"specialtext_181","What is the mission this time?"
"specialtext_182","It is said that demonic aura has appeared at the Longling Tomb in Dragon's Peak."
"specialtext_183","(The chaos is spreading uncontrollably...)"
"specialtext_184","What?"
"specialtext_185","It's nothing. If that's all, I'll leave."
"specialtext_186","Take this <color=yellow>Jade Pendant</color>. It should be useful for you."
"specialtext_187","Click here to set out and enter the battlefield."
"specialtext_188","Hahaha! It looks like we have a newcomer!"
"specialtext_189","You can switch between Characters in the Hero tab."
"specialtext_190","Wake up!"
"specialtext_191","What happened……"
"specialtext_192","It's just the art of soul regeneration."
"specialtext_193","Refine Soul Essence you've earned to unlock more talents that will be kept forever in the current save data."
"specialtext_194","Unused Soul Essence cannot be brought back to the Inn. Please try your best to consume them before leaving."
"specialtext_195","(*Unlock the Dimension Pouch to make the Jade Pendant bring some of the Soul Essence back to the Inn*)"
"specialtext_196","Since the source of demonic aura was found, the Yoruhime-Maru was eliminated, and the Coastal Rogue were chased away, you can finally take a break."
"specialtext_197","The human heart is an abyss that's filled with greed. Therefore, evil will always exist. Besides, I've always thought there was something strange about the Yoruhime-Maru."
"specialtext_198","Although there will always be someone who summons the demonic aura for personal gain, whenever demonic aura is mentioned, you overreact. Demonic aura have already been wiped out, so why are you still so paranoid?"
"specialtext_199","Hmm……By the way, have you ever heard of the Invincible Army?"
"specialtext_200","That's just a thousand-year-old legend."
"specialtext_201","What? Are you suspecting that this has something to do with the Invincible Army?"
"specialtext_202","Even so, the Longling Tomb bears traces that it was searched, and the Yoruhime-Maru certainly has something to do with the escape to place overseas. Over the years, there's been suspicion that“he”brought thousands of people to Ryukyu."
"specialtext_203","Over the years, there's been suspicion that“he”brought thousands of people to Ryukyu."
"specialtext_204","There had been no word from the Spirit Realm for years, and even with the chaos happening all around, things remain silent. Besides the people of the Spirit Realm, there may be only one who has the power to summon demonic aura. Could it be?"

"specialtext_486","The Longling Tomb was once a place to seal demonic aura, but now it is perilous because the demonic aura has gone rampant."

"specialtext_498","The demonic aura is most likely congregating in the same area instead of dissipating. I am afraid that it will come back."
"specialtext_499","I have to investigate it further."
"specialtext_500","I can't believe that my partner, who had fought alongside me in the past, is the absolute bane of this tragedy."
"specialtext_501","He had only himself to blame for this disaster—no need to be so chagrined at yourself, Uncle Bao."
"specialtext_502","This demonic aura is capable of invading the mind of any creature and corrupting their mentality, making them a beast of evil within. It shouldn't exist in the world."
"specialtext_503","Anyway, the world should be at peace now."
"specialtext_504","I hope so."
